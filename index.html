    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Swami Vivekananda Merit-cum-Means Scholarship (SVMCM)</strong> is an important support mechanism for students in West Bengal. Despite careful processes, applicants occasionally face issues — delays in verification, mismatch in details, non-receipt of payments, or technical problems with the portal. 
      This guide explains a clear, step-by-step grievance redressal path so you can resolve problems quickly and with minimum stress.
    </p>

    <div class="notice">
      <strong>Quick pointer:</strong> Always keep your Application ID, registered mobile number and a copy of your acknowledgement/receipt handy — you will need them when filing or following up on any complaint.
    </div>

    <h2 id="why">Why a Formal Grievance Process Matters</h2>
    <p>
      A formal grievance mechanism ensures transparency, creates an auditable trail, and speeds up resolution. Informal requests (phone calls or casual emails) often get lost. By using the prescribed grievance channels you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a timestamped record of your complaint.</li>
      <li>Allow responsible officers to escalate internally and trace progress.</li>
      <li>Have documented proof if you need to escalate to higher authorities later.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="how">How to File a Grievance: Step-by-Step</h2>
    <p>
      Below is a practical sequence for filing SVMCM grievances so your issue is logged and acted upon effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 1 — Collect evidence</h3>
    <p>
      Before filing, assemble the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Application ID and registration details</li>
      <li>Screenshots of portal pages showing errors or statuses</li>
      <li>Copies of uploaded documents (marksheet, income certificate, bank passbook page)</li>
      <li>A copy of the acknowledgement slip or email confirmation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2 — Check institution level first</h3>
    <p>
      Many verification and payment delays are resolved at the college/school level. Contact your college scholarship or administrative officer and:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask whether your institution has verified and forwarded your application.</li>
      <li>Request the exact date and person who completed verification (keep it on record).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3 — Use the official portal grievance/feedback facility</h3>
    <p>
      If institution assistance does not resolve the matter, file a formal grievance on the SVMCM portal. The portal maintains a grievance/feedback or helpdesk section — use it to lodge a complaint so the department has a traceable ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you submit, include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear subject line (e.g., “Payment not received — Application ID: XXXXX”)</li>
      <li>A concise description of the problem</li>
      <li>Attachments: screenshots, acknowledgement slip, bank passbook page</li>
      <li>Preferred contact details (registered mobile & email)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4 — Note the ticket number & expected timelines</h3>
    <p>
      After submission the portal should issue a ticket or reference number. Note this down immediately. Typical acknowledgement responses often mention a resolution timeline (for example: 10–15 working days). Use the ticket number for all follow-ups.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5 — Follow up politely and persistently</h3>
    <p>
      If the portal’s timeline passes without resolution, follow up using the same ticket number. Maintain a polite but firm tone — escalate only after reasonable time has elapsed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="track">Tracking Your Grievance & SVMCM Status</h2>
    <p>
      You can concurrently track two things: your original scholarship application status and your grievance ticket progress.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Application status:</strong> Log in to the portal and check application updates (Under Verification, Approved, Sanctioned, Payment Disbursed). For status lookups use the portal’s tracking feature or the student dashboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grievance ticket status:</strong> Use the portal’s “Grievance / Helpdesk” section to view current status and staff replies. Keep screenshots or exported copies of replies as evidence.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you need to verify or cross-check application progress while raising a complaint, you can use the portal’s track feature — for convenience you can click the <a href="https://swamivivekanandascholarship.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swmcm status check</a> link on the official site to jump to tracking and helpdesk options.
    </p>

    <h2 id="common-issues">Common Grievances & How They Are Usually Resolved</h2>
    <p>Below are frequent problems students face and the practical remedies that typically work:</p>

    <h3>1. Verification not completed by institution</h3>
    <p>
      Resolution: Request written confirmation (email or screenshot) from your institution that they have verified and forwarded your application; forward that confirmation to the portal helpdesk along with your ticket.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Name/marks/bank details mismatch</h3>
    <p>
      Resolution: Submit corrected documents and a signed institution verification letter confirming the correction. Use the portal’s correction window (if available) or attach documents to your grievance ticket.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Payment pending / not credited</h3>
    <p>
      Resolution: Provide bank passbook screenshot showing account number and IFSC. Ask the institution to confirm the bank details submitted in the portal. If details match but payment not received, request the finance department to re-check payment batch and transaction trace.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Portal technical errors (upload or form submission)</h3>
    <p>
      Resolution: Capture error screenshots, note date & time, clear cache and retry using recommended browsers (Chrome/Firefox). If persistent, attach screenshots to grievance ticket and request manual intervention.
    </p>

    <h2 id="escalate">Escalation: When & How to Move Your Complaint Up</h2>
    <p>
      If initial grievance tickets do not get resolved within promised timelines, use a structured escalation path:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Follow up via the same ticket and request an expected resolution date.</li>
      <li>If unresolved, ask for the matter to be marked “urgent” and request escalation to the nodal officer or regional coordinator listed on the portal.</li>
      <li>Escalate to the Directorate/Department level through the portal’s higher-authority grievance channel (if available).</li>
      <li>As a last resort, consider contacting your local MLA/education department public grievance cell — but keep this as a measured step after all official channels are exhausted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="sample">Sample Grievance Template (Copy & Use)</h2>
    <p>Use or adapt the template below when filing your ticket. Keep it concise and include attachments.</p>

    <div class="code">
To: SVMCM Helpdesk / Portal Grievance Cell
Subject: Payment not received — Application ID: ABCD12345

    <h2 id="timelines">Reasonable Timelines & What to Expect</h2>
    <p>
      Typical timelines vary by grievance type:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Technical portal issues: 3–10 working days</li>
      <li>Document verification discrepancies: 7–21 working days (depends on institution response)</li>
      <li>Payment trace & re-issue: 10–30 working days (may involve finance department and bank processing)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are approximate ranges. Use the ticket number to request status updates if the promised timeline lapses.
    </p>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

    <h3>Q — I filed a grievance but got no reply. What should I do?</h3>
    <p>
      A — First, confirm the portal issued a ticket number at submission. If not, resubmit making sure the form completes. If you have a ticket and no reply after the timeline, follow up using the ticket and request escalation to the nodal officer.
    </p>

    <h3>Q — Can I raise multiple grievances for the same issue?</h3>
    <p>
      A — Avoid duplicate tickets for the same problem; they complicate tracking. Instead, update the existing ticket with new information or additional attachments.
    </p>

    <h3>Q — Who resolves institution verification delays?</h3>
    <p>
      A — The institution scholarship/administrative office is responsible for verification. Always ask them for written confirmation and forward that to the portal if the department requires further proof.
    </p>

    <h3>Q — Will raising a grievance delay processing for others?</h3>
    <p>
      A — No. Legitimate grievances are processed individually. Be factual and provide documents — frivolous or aggressive complaints may be deprioritized.
    </p>

    <h2 id="final">Final Tips for Faster Resolution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>File grievances during working days and avoid public holidays for faster response.</li>
      <li>Attach clear, legible documents and concise descriptions — this reduces back-and-forth requests.</li>
      <li>Keep a single point of contact (your registered email/phone) for consistency.</li>
      <li>Keep polite and factual language in all communications — it speeds up cooperation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A robust grievance process protects applicant rights and strengthens the scholarship system. Use the official portal tools first, keep your evidence organized, and escalate courteously when needed. This approach will usually resolve most issues satisfactorily.
